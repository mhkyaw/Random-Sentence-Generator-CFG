# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
# 
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.

# The basic grammar rules.  Here's what the abbreviations stand for:
#    S  = sentence
#    NP = noun phrase
#    VP = verb phrase
#    PP = prepositional phrase
#    Det = determiner (sometimes called "article")
#    Prep = preposition
#    Adj = adjective

# Change3: Verbs in infinitive form




1 NP	NP PP
20 PP	Prep NP
#     Change2: Another change I made was that I changed the count of PP     #     going to Prepositions and NP from 1 to 20 so that sentences sound more #     natural with prepositional phrases. This would not affect the length  #     drastically as the other component the effects the length,NP -> NP +   #     PP is still set at 1.


2 Noun	Adj Noun
#      Change1: I decreased the count of Noun going to adj+noun to 2 because #      double adjectives make sentences sound less natural. 


# Vocabulary.  Your program can see that "ate" is a terminal
# symbol because there exists no rule for rewriting it.
# Any symbol that can rewrite as a terminal (or a string of 
# terminals, like "chief of staff") is called a "preterminal."  Notice 
# that a preterminal is a special kind of nonterminal.

#Part3Change2: adding past tense without objects to the list

3 Det	the
#      Change3: I made a third change, but it’s less of grammar and more of #      word choice. Conversational language usually hovers around specific  #      topics within context, hence the article “the” is more common than “a”#      , but not drastically so I increased the count of “the” from 1 to 3.
